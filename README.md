# Restangular fork by kevinrenskers

Original repo and docs: https://github.com/mgonto/restangular

Changes in my fork:

* Easy usable via NPM
* Removed underscore / lodash dependancy
* Added `get`, `all` and `withHttpConfig` to Restangular as-a-service usage

To install:

```
npm i --save https://github.com/kevinrenskers/restangular
```
